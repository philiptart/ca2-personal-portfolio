## Key Files

#### index.html

This file has been built to meet semantic html 5.0, logical, and SEO accessibility requirements.

#### styles.css (Available in /assets/css directory)

This file has been designed to meet semantic, and logical requirements based on the index.html structure while coded with flexbox and media queries to make the application responsive.

#### image and pdf files (Available in /assets/images, and /assets/pdf-files directories)

Supporting image files were created to capture previous projects and my older CV was added in pdf format.

## Disclaimer

This is my first attempt at coding from scratch a html/css file set so expect the odd issue with responsive adjustments transitioning between some viewports while meeting all current web standards. The version of the live file has had the hyperlinks adjusted to the stated domain inc css style sheet, and image assets.
